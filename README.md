# bain

## Setting up the repo

- clone the repo using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bohooslav/bain.git
```

- enter the directory

```bash
cd bain/
```

- set up local enviroment

```bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

- install reqirements using pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- run server (I am using 0 host for better debugging. You are free to use whatever you want)

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

- and go to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>
- check if everything is correct and you do not see any error. You will not see any book, because to do that you should have installed PostreSQL and fill it with translations. Ask me to get it  <https:t.me/Boguslavv>. Using pgAdmin or cmd, create a database `bain`, than run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

 and then insert the translation there.

- the next step is to go to `./bolls/static/bolls/` to install Imba dependencies

```bash
cd bolls/static/bolls/
npm install
```

- than watch the changes in files to compile them

```bash
npm run watch
```

After that you should be able to debug it.

### Checklist before any deploy
- sw
- npm run build
- collectstatic
- deploy

I use the next command to make a deployment. For it, you need to have installed gcloud app and be logged in my account (haha). Do not use it. It will not be successful. It is for myself.

```bash
cd ~/bain/bolls/static/bolls/ && npm run build && source ~/env/bin/activate && cd ~/bain && python manage.py collectstatic && cd ~/bain &&gcloud app deploy
```
